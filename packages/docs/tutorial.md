<h1>Meteor and React integration tutorial</h1>

This short tutorial will get you acquainted with building a simple app that uses Meteor and React together. This isn't meant to be an introduction to React itself; if you haven't yet, [read Facebook's tutorial about React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) to get acquainted.

## Step 1: Creating an app, adding React

In your terminal, type the following:

```sh
meteor create my-react-app
cd my-react-app
meteor add react
```

To run your app, type the `meteor` command in your app directory.

## Step 2: Adding your first component

First, let's delete the `my-react-app.js` file that Meteor generated for us, and everything except the `<head>...</head>` tag in `my-react-app.html`. Instead of writing HTML templates, we'll be constructing our page from React components.

We'll write our code in a new file we'll call `my-react-app.jsx`. In that file, put the following code:

```js
var App = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return <div>Hello world!</div>;
  }
});

if (Meteor.isClient) {
  React.render(<App />, document.body);
}
```

JSX is a special file format that React developers use which lets you embed snippets of HTML-like markup inside your JavaScript. This markup is compiled to regular JavaScript code by Meteor. [Read more about JSX here.](jsx.md)

In this file we just created, we have defined a React component with `createClass` and then rendered it to the `<body>` element of the page. If you run your app, you will see the text `Hello world!` displayed on the screen, indicating that you have successfully compiled and run an app with Meteor and React. Congratulations!

## Step 3: Displaying reactive data

In this step, we will throw in a `Mongo.Collection` so that our app has data. This class should be instantiated on the client and server, and the data will be automatically synchronized between the two. For more about collections, see the [Meteor tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/try/3).

```js
var Tasks = new Mongo.Collection("tasks");

var App = React.createClass({
  mixins: [MeteorDataMixin],
  trackMeteorData(props, state) {
    // This method knows how to listen to Meteor's reactive data sources,
    // such as collection queries
    return {
      // Return an array with all items in the collection
      tasks: Tasks.find().fetch()
    }
  },
  render() {
    return <ul>{
      // Access the data from trackMeteorData() on this.data
      this.data.tasks.map(function (task) {
        return <li>task.content</li>
      })
    }</ul>;
  }
});

if (Meteor.isClient) {
  React.render(<App />, document.body);
}
```

## Step 4: Modifying data from a user event

Now that our app is getting more complicated, we should split it into multiple components. Also, to modify the database in a validated way we have added a Method. Read more about methods in the [Meteor tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/try/10).

```js
var Tasks = new Mongo.Collection("tasks");

var List = React.createClass({
  mixins: [MeteorDataMixin],
  trackMeteorData(props, state) {
    // This function knows how to listen to Meteor's reactive data sources,
    // such as collection queries
    return {
      // Returns an array with all items in the collection
      tasks: Tasks.find().fetch()
    }
  },
  render() {
    return <ul>{
      // Access the data from trackMeteorData() on this.data
      this.data.tasks.map(function (task) {
        return <li>task.content</li>
      })
    }</ul>
  }
});

var NewTaskForm = React.createClass({
  onSubmit(event) {
    var taskContent = event.target.content.value;
    Meteor.call('insertTask', {
      content: taskContent
    });
  },
  render() {
    return <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
      <input type='text' name='content' placeholder='Add a task...'/>
    </form>
  }
})

var App = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return <div>
      <List />
      <NewTaskForm />
    </div>
  }
});

Meteor.methods({
  insertTask: function (task) {
    // Validate the data
    check(content, {
      text: String
    });

    // Insert into MongoDB and Minimongo
    Tasks.insert(task);
  }
});

if (Meteor.isClient) {
  React.render(<App />, document.body);
}
```
